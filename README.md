#### Using BMAD with Claude Code

Once Claude Code is installed and BMAD is set up, you can leverage BMAD methodology directly through Claude:

**BMAD Commands in Claude Code:**
```bash
# Generate BMAD team files for Claude
*help                    # Get BMAD assistance
*analyst                 # Start with BMAD analyst agent
#bmad-orchestrator      # Use BMAD orchestrator for project guidance

# BMAD workflow integration
claude /bmad-init        # Initialize BMAD workflow in current project
claude /bmad-analyze     # Analyze project with BMAD methodology
claude /bmad-architect   # Generate architecture using BMAD patterns
```

**Recommended Claude + BMAD Workflow:**
1. **Planning Phase**: Use `*analyst` to define PRD and requirements
2. **Architecture Phase**: Use `#bmad-orchestrator` for system design
3. **Development Phase**: Switch to Claude Code IDE for implementation
4. **Integration**: Use BMAD expansion packs through Claude commands

**BMAD Team File Integration:**
- Upload `/dist/teams/team-fullstack.txt` to Claude for comprehensive development support
- Use BMAD agents directly through Claude Code slash commands
- Leverage Claude's context with BMAD's structured methodology

## Usage Monitoring & Costs

Track your Claude Code usage and costs to manage your AI development budget effectively.

### Install UV Package Manager

First, install `uv` - a fast Python package installer:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install Claude Monitor

Install the [Claude Code Usage Monitor](https://github.com/Maciek-roboblog/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor) for real-time usage tracking:
```bash
uv tool install claude-monitor
```

### Real-Time Usage Monitoring

Monitor your Claude usage in real-time with your specific plan and timezone:
```bash
# For Claude Pro Max plan in Europe/Helsinki timezone
claude-monitor --plan max20 --timezone Europe/Helsinki

# Adjust plan and timezone as needed:
# Plans: pro5, max20 (number represents daily message limit)
# Timezone: Your local timezone (e.g., America/New_York, Asia/Tokyo)
```

### Daily Usage Reports

Get daily usage summaries using ccusage:
```bash
npx ccusage@latest
```

### Monitoring Best Practices

- **Set up monitoring early**: Install monitoring tools before heavy development sessions
- **Check usage regularly**: Review daily reports to track consumption patterns
- **Plan usage accordingly**: Use monitoring data to optimize your development workflow
- **Consider timezone settings**: Accurate timezone ensures correct daily reset tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Container Won't Start
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Check Docker Desktop settings for resource allocation (CPU, Memory)
- Try: `docker system prune` to clean up Docker resources

### Permission Issues
- The container runs as a non-root user by default
- To run as root, uncomment in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:
  ```json
  "remoteUser": "root"
  ```

### Slow Performance
- Increase Docker Desktop resource limits
- Windows: Ensure WSL 2 is enabled for better performance
- macOS: Check Docker Desktop preferences for resource allocation

### Extension Issues
- Extensions are installed in the container, not locally
- To add more extensions, modify `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:
  ```json
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "extension.id.here"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

### BMAD-Method Issues

#### Installation Problems
```bash
# Clear npm cache if installation fails
npm cache clean --force
npx bmad-method install

# For permission issues, try with sudo (Linux/macOS)
sudo npx bmad-method install
```

#### Update Issues
```bash
# If updates fail, force reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm run install:bmad
```

#### Node.js Version Issues
- BMAD requires Node.js 20+
- This container includes the correct version
- Verify with: `node --version`

#### Claude Code + BMAD Integration Issues
```bash
# If BMAD commands don't work in Claude Code
claude --version        # Verify Claude Code is installed
bmad-method --version   # Verify BMAD is installed

# Refresh BMAD team files if outdated
cd BMAD-METHOD
git pull
npm run build

# Re-upload team files to Claude if needed
# File location: ./dist/teams/team-fullstack.txt
```

**Common Integration Problems:**
- **BMAD commands not recognized**: Ensure BMAD is installed in the same environment as Claude Code
- **Team files not working**: Re-download latest team files from `/dist/teams/` directory
- **Slash commands failing**: Verify GitHub integration is properly configured with `/install-github-app`

### Usage Monitoring Issues

#### Claude Monitor Installation Problems
```bash
# If uv installation fails, try alternative method
pip install uv
uv tool install claude-monitor

# Or install directly with pip
pip install claude-monitor
```

#### Monitoring Command Issues
```bash
# If claude-monitor command not found, check PATH
echo $PATH
which claude-monitor

# Refresh shell after uv installation
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

#### Timezone Configuration Problems
- Use standard timezone format: `Area/City` (e.g., `Europe/Helsinki`, `America/New_York`)
- List available timezones: `timedatectl list-timezones` (Linux)
- For Windows WSL: Use Linux timezone format

#### Usage Tracking Not Working
- Ensure Claude Code is running when using monitoring tools
- Check if monitoring tools have proper permissions
- Verify Claude Code authentication is active
